          I am switched-on, dynamic, and mentally dexterous with strong work
          ethic professional. Comfortable with ambiguity and driven by
          intellectual challenges I’ve combined my broad technical and
          interpersonal skills with persuasive talks to prevail and promote my
          ideas, solutions and/or better ways of working. My passion for
          technology and intellectual curiosity empowers me to tackle a
          broad-spectrum of challenges in both professional and private life. My
          work experience commenced as an Accounts Payable Assistant in 2011 and
          I have progressed in various Finance roles throughout constantly
          adding to my work persona traits. My most recent work experience gave
          me the opportunity to use my IT skills and sustain my passion for
          technology, augment my system administration experience and enhance my
          data engineering capabilities. I speak and write fluently in 3
          languages, I love cycling swimming and outdoor activities.
